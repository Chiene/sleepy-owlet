# Sleepy Owlet

A desktop application is for keeping your eyes healthy.

It will be supported on Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.

# Build Sleep Owlet application

You can easily build your own app by using `make`, then we will create
a standalone app in **ext/** folder

# Powerd by Node-Webkit

We decided to use [node-webkit (nw)](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) to help us build cross platform applications. If you are interested in node-webkit, please click on the link to check more details :)
